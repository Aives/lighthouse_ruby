#If you pretend to be a dog and bark ("woof") at him, he will go a bit nuts and woof back at you three 
#times, pretty loudly: "WOOF WOOF WOOF"

#If you explicitly use his name and tell him to stop (either "shakil stop" or "Shakil STOP!") he will 
#not respond back with a bark (enjoy your moment of peace)

#If you pretend to be a cat and "meow" at him, he will go berserk and woof back at you five times: 
#"woof woof woof woof woof"

#If you say anything else but with the word "treat" thrown into the mix, he won’t bark back, thinking 
#he’ll be getting a treat

#If you say "go away" he manages to actually leave you alone by leaving the room.
